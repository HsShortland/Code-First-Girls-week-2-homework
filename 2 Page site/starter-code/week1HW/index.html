      <h2>What does it involve?</h2>
      <p> As a Biomedical Scientist working in a Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, my main role is to diagnose bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections in humans. It involves testing a variety of samples from the body including:
        <ul>
          <li>Urine</li>
          <li>Blood</li>
          <li>Swabs from different body sites</li>
          <li>Tissue and fluids</li>
          <li>Faeces</li>
          <li>Sputum</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>How the pandemic has changed the laboratory I work in!</h2>
      <p>The laboratory I work in was already pretty busy. When the pandemic hit and the first and most extreme lock-down started, our usual testing dropped in numbers. The bright side of this was it was the opportunity to get the PCR testing for COVID-19 up and running.
</p>
      <p>Once things started to settle into routine and hospital services returned to normal, so did the number of tests the laboratory perform. We have managed to incorporate COVID testing alongside our usual testing because of the opportunities afforded to us by the pandemic such as employing more staff to deal with the increased work-load that came with COVID-19 testing.</p>
